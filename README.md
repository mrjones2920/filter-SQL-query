# Filter SQL Query
<h2>Introduction</h2>

In this lab, you’ll apply basic filters to SQL queries to retrieve information from a database. You’ll use SQL to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they’re in. You’ll be using the MariaDB shell to run SQL queries.


<h2>What you’ll do</h2>
You have multiple tasks in this lab:
 
 - Return information on machines and their operating systems
 - Filter for machines with a specific operating system
 - Filter for employees in specific departments
 - Filter for employees who use specific machines

<h2>Scenario</h2>
In this scenario, you need to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they’re in. Your team needs this data to perform various tasks, such as running updates, posting a privacy notice in certain departments, and sending an alert to an employee with an issue on a machine.

You are responsible for finding the required information by querying a database. You’ll add filters to your queries to locate the information more quickly.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll list all organization machines and their operating systems. Second, you’ll list all machines with the operating system OS 2. Third, you’ll list all the employees in the Finance and Sales departments. Fourth, you’ll obtain information about machines.
